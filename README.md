Groovy KalBar Web App

## Name
Our project is named **Groovy KalBar**. It's the perfect way to showcase the fun learning experience our course offers.

## Description
As educators, we understand the challenges that come with delivering subject matter effectively. We recognize the importance of employing creative and innovative teaching strategies to enhance the learning experience for our students.

To that end, we have developed a user-friendly web application that offers three different subjects: maths, English, and tourism. Our platform is designed to provide students with an exceptional learning experience. Through this application, students can easily register an account and log in to access any of these subjects. Additionally, they can select from a menu of subjects to explore and choose the topics that interest them the most.

Our goal is to provide students with a seamless and interactive learning experience that inspires their curiosity and encourages them to explore new subjects and ideas.
